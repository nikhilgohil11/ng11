I was working on my project at my desk and then I left my desk for some time after returning back, I saw my Project Manager’s Pic set as a my Mac’s wallpaper.

He was smiling and showing thumbs up with a 𝐁𝐈𝐆 smile. 😊👍🏻

He did not do anything wrong with my machine 💻, but this incident made me alert about my security.
So Now, I wanted my machine’s screen to be locked with quick action. There is a ways to make it on Mac OS X. Follow the process to setup your machine for shortcut keys to lock your screen.

1. Open **System Preferences > Security & Privacy.**
2. In the **General** tab, select **Require Password after sleep or screen saver begins**, and select **immediately** from drop down.
3. You will be prompted for Password to change screen lock settings. 

Now, **Close System Preference** Now we are ready to lock the screen. **𝕎OO𝕙ȯȫ‼**

Press **Control+Shift+Power or Eject** to **Sleep Mac**

This automatically lock the screen and if you press Space bar key it will ask for Password. Whoop you are Safe now. 😃

Below are a few commands which I tried while doing this process.

**Control+Command+Option+Power or Eject => Shut Down immediately**

**Control+Power => Prompt for options**

Note: _ Don’t press this unless you want to restart, I did this accidentally and all my application state lost 😩 . So try this on your own Risk. 😛

<b>Control+Command+Power or Eject => Restart</b>

Now, This will log you off from the Machine so do it wisely. 🙃

<b>Command+Shift+Q => Log off of your Mac</b>
