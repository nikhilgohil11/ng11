Now I am looking for second best thing in any language. It is a conditional statement. Conditional statement makes our conversation more interesting and plays important roles to conclude conversations (Sometimes 😛). This helps same way in programming languages too.


<b>If</b>

```js
student_passed = true
if student_passed:
print(“Congratulations!!!”)
```



<b>If… else</b>

```js
student_passed = true
if student_passed:
print(“Congratulations!!!”)
else:
print(“Please collect your exam results from the office”)
```
