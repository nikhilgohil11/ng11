Telerik NativeScript tns CLI generates iOS and android project in platform/ios and platform/android folders respectively. If we switch between Git branches it may stop working

In this case you can remove existing platforms by following command

<b>tns platform remove iOS</b> and/or <b>tns platform remove android</b>

Now to make work properly you can either add your need platform by

<b>tns platform remove iOS</b> or

<b>tns platform add android</b>

or you can add Both the platforms by

<b>tns install</b>

Now you can run project by

<b>tns run ios</b> or <b>tns run android</b>
