I was working on my project at my desk and then I left my desk for some time after returning back, I saw my Project Manager’s Pic set as a my Mac’s wallpaper.

He was smiling and showing thumbs up with a 𝐁𝐈𝐆 smile. 😊👍🏻

He did not do anything wrong with my machine 💻, but this incident made me alert about my security.
So Now, I wanted my machine’s screen to be locked with quick action. There is a ways to make it on Mac OS X. Follow the process to setup your machine for shortcut keys to lock your screen.

<b>1.</b> Open <b>System Preferences > Security & Privacy.</b>

<b>2.</b> In the <b>General</b> tab, select <b>Require Password after sleep or screen saver begins</b>, and select <b>immediately</b> from drop down.

<b>3.</b> You will be prompted for Password to change screen lock settings. 


Now, <b>Close System Preference</b> Now we are ready to lock the screen. <b>𝕎OO𝕙ȯȫ‼</b>


Press <b>Control+Shift+Power or Eject</b> to <b>Sleep Mac</b>

This automatically lock the screen and if you press Space bar key it will ask for Password. Whoop you are Safe now. 😃

Below are a few commands which I tried while doing this process.


<b>Control+Command+Option+Power or Eject => Shut Down immediately

Control+Power => Prompt for options

</b>

Don’t press this unless you want to restart, I did this accidentally and all my application state lost 😩 . So try this on your own Risk. 😛

<b>Control+Command+Power or Eject => Restart</b>

Now, This will log you off from the Machine so do it wisely. 🙃


<b>Command+Shift+Q => Log off of your Mac</b>
