I am planning to learn python. So to go through official docs or any python learning book. I have extracts few things which are basics and must to write code in python. I will post each one by one.

Let me start with <b>Variables</b>. They vary and their ability is always visible in any programming language.
In python declaring variable is just variable <b>name</b> and it‚Äôs <b>value</b>

So if I want Integer 10 in variable score then I will write

```js
score = 10
```

For String ‚ÄúNikhil Gohil‚Äù in variable name, then

```js
name = "Nikhil Gohil"
```

For Float 11.11 in variable duration, then

```js
duration = 11.11
```

For Boolean true in variable is_developer, then

```js
is_developer = true
```

Now, suppose we don‚Äôt know the exact value for variable and want to declare it for later use then we can assign <b>None</b>. I found it from this stack overflow thread.

```js
variable_name = None
```

Oh! So like other languages I can assign multiple variable too.

```js
first_name = last_name = address = None
```

Isn‚Äôt it simple? It is. üëåüèª

I will post my another extract in next post. üôÉ
